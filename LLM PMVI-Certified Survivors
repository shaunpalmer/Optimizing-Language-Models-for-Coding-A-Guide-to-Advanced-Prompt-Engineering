# ✨ Suggested Twitter/X Roast Thread:

🪦 I ran 10+ local LLMs through a brutal test called **PMVI** (Production Minimal Viable Intelligence).  
If they failed a logic problem or couldn't spell *"maintenance"*...  
🔥 They got deleted.

Here's who passed, who flopped, and who hallucinated into the void 🧵👇
