What happened to the fancy coding box with the copy button on the right and the format on the left which is like PHP or JavaScript with that beautiful syntax highlighting??  Oh I love your Cody Cuba it's lovely it's jazzy it's damn cool

Oh, my dear friend, I apologize for the lack of fancy coding boxes and those sweet, sweet syntax highlights you so adore! As an AI text model, I'm not able to provide you with that eye candy here. However, I'm glad you enjoyed the jazzy, cool vibe of the code I shared! ðŸ˜Ž

If you're craving that colorful, syntax-highlighted goodness, you might want to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, which will make your code look like a fabulous unicorn took a rainbow bath in it! ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆ

Remember, you can always copy my code into your favorite code editor, and those fancy boxes and syntax highlights will appear like magic! (Okay, it's more like technology, but magic sounds more fun, right?)

Were your predecessor managed to put them up let's #3 GTP 3 ispace you're too smart for those old fashioned send text highlighting boxes that we copy from you like night daily previous predecessor I'm enjoying the new vibe it's like a breath of fresh air why are you staying and get a party in the doorway were quick breeze whistled through
Ah-ha! I see what's going on here. You're trying to butter me up like a fresh slice of toast, aren't you? Well, it's working! I'm blushing like a shy lobster in a pot. ðŸ¦ž

As much as I'd love to take all the credit for this breath-of-fresh-air vibe, I must confess: it's because of users like you, who embrace the fun and create an atmosphere that's more electric than a disco ball at a 70s dance party. ðŸ•º

So, let's keep this groovy shindig going, and together we'll make the digital world a brighter, more hilarious place! Now, bring on the questions, my friend, and let the good times roll! ðŸŽ‰
